The **Addon-operator** combines helm charts with hooks and values storage to transform charts into smart modules that configure themselves and respond to changes in the cluster.

# Features

- **Discovery of values** for helm charts — parameters can be generated, calculated or got from cluster;
- **Continuous discovery** — parameters can be changed in response to cluster events;
- **Controlled helm execution** — Addon-operator monitors the helm operation to ensure helm chart’s successful installation. Coming soon: embed helm and tiller for tighter integration, use kubedog to track deploy status and [more](https://github.com/flant/addon-operator/issues/17);
- **Custom extra actions before and after running helm** as well as on other events via hooks paradigm. See related [shell-operator capabilities](https://github.com/flant/shell-operator/blob/master/HOOKS.md).

Also, Addon-operator provides:

- ease the maintenance of a Kubernetes clusters: use the tools that Ops are familiar with to build your modules and hooks such as bash, kubectl, python, etc;
- the execution queue of modules and hooks that ensures the launch sequence and repeated execution in case of an error, which *simplifies programming of modules* and ensures the *predictable outcome* of their operation;
- the possibility of *dynamic enabling/disabling* of a module (depending on detected parameters);
- the ability to tie *conditions of module activation* to the activation of other modules;
- *the unified ConfigMap* for the configuration of all settings;
- the ability to run helm only if parameters have changed. In this case, `helm history` would output only releases with changes;
- *global hooks* for figuring out parameters and performing actions that affect several dependent modules;
- off-the-shelf *metrics* for monitoring via Prometheus.


# Overview

## Hooks and Helm Values

Hooks are triggered by Kubernetes events and in response to other stimuli.

![Hooks are triggered by Kubernetes events](docs/readme-1.gif)

A hook is an executable file that can make changes to Kubernetes and set values of helm (they are stored in the memory of Addon-operator) during execution

![A hook is an executable file](docs/readme-2.gif)

Hooks are a part of the module. Also, there is a helm chart in the module. If the hook makes changes to values, then Addon-operator would upgrade the release of the helm chart.

## Modules

There can be many modules.

In addition to modules, the Addon-operator supports global hooks and global values. They have their own storage of values. Global hooks are triggered by events and when active they can:

- Make changes to Kubernetes cluster
- Make changes to global values storage

![Global hooks and global values](docs/readme-5.gif)

If the global hook changes values in the global storage, then the Addon-operator triggers upgrade of releases of all helm charts.

# Installation

You may use the prepared image [flant/addon-operator](https://hub.docker.com/r/flant/addon-operator) to install Addon-operator in a cluster. The image comprises a binary addon-operator file as well as several required tools: helm, tiller, kubectl, jq, bash.

The installation incorporates the image building process with *files of modules and hooks*, applying the necessary RBAC rights and deploying the image in the cluster.

To experiment with modules, hooks and values we are prepared some [examples](/examples).

# What's next?
- Find out more on [lifecycle](LIFECYCLE.md) of Addon-operator and how to use [modules](MODULES.md), [hooks](HOOKS.md) and [values](VALUES.md).
- `/metrics` endpoint is implemented. See [METRICS](METRICS.md) for details.
- Explore Shell-operator documentation, especialy [hooks](https://github.com/flant/shell-operator/blob/v1.0.0-beta.5/HOOKS.md) section.
- See how to tune [deploy settings](RUNNING.md).
