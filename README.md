**Addon-operator** combines Helm charts with hooks and values storage to transform charts into smart modules that configure themselves and respond to changes in the cluster. It is a sister project for [shell-operator](https://github.com/flant/shell-operator) and is actively used in [Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse) to implement its modules.

# Features

- **Discovery of values** for Helm charts — parameters can be generated, calculated or retrieved from the cluster;
- **Continuous discovery** — parameters can be changed in response to cluster events;
- **Controlled Helm execution** — addon-operator monitors the Helm operation to ensure the Helm chart’s successful installation. Coming soon: use kubedog to track deploy status and more;
- **Custom extra actions before and after running Helm** as well as any other events via the hooks paradigm. See related [shell-operator capabilities](https://github.com/flant/shell-operator/blob/master/HOOKS.md).

Additionally, addon-operator provides:

- ease of maintenance of Kubernetes clusters: use the tools that Ops are familiar with to build your modules and hooks such as Bash, kubectl, Python, etc;
- the execution queue of modules and hooks that ensures the launch sequence and repeated execution in case of an error, which *simplifies programming of modules* and ensures *predictable outcome* of their operation;
- the possibility of *dynamic enabling/disabling* of a module (depending on detected parameters);
- the ability to tie *conditions of module activation* to the activation of other modules;
- *the unified ConfigMap* for the configuration of all settings;
- the ability to run Helm only if parameters have changed. In this case, `helm history` would output only releases with changes;
- *global hooks* for figuring out parameters and performing actions that affect several dependent modules;
- off-the-shelf *metrics* for monitoring via Prometheus.

# Documentation

Please see the [docs](https://flant.github.io/addon-operator/) for more in-depth information and supported features.

# Installation

You may use a prepared image [flant/addon-operator](https://hub.docker.com/r/flant/addon-operator) to install addon-operator in a cluster. The image comprises a binary `addon-operator` file as well as several required tools: `helm`, `kubectl`, `jq`, `bash`.

The installation incorporates the image building process with *files of modules and hooks*, applying the necessary RBAC rights and deploying the image in the cluster.

## Examples

To experiment with modules, hooks, and values we've prepared some [examples](/examples).

[Deckhouse Kubernetes Platform](https://deckhouse.io/) was an initial reason to create addon-operator, thus [its modules](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse/tree/main/modules) might become a vital source of inspiration for implementing your own modules.

Sharing your examples of using addon-operator is much appreciated. Please, use the [relevant Discussions section](https://github.com/flant/addon-operator/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) for that.
